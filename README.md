# WePair Health
WePair Health is a platform that is designed to connect community health workers with healthcare organizations in order to provide competent care to vulnerable communities. Due to the proprietary nature of the code only selected, approved snippets of my code can be shared in this repository. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and ReactJS code.

Responsibilities at WePair Health included a dynamic and customizable email service that allowed users and providers to receive automated emails when such user or provider signed up or tried to contact WePair Health.
